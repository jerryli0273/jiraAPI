        "\n",
        "In this section, you will create a CNN for the CIFAR dataset, and submit your predictions to Kaggle. It is recommended that you use GPU acceleration for this part.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here are some of the components you should consider using:\n",
        "1. `nn.Conv2d`\n",
        "2. `nn.ReLU`\n",
        "3. `nn.Linear`\n",
        "4. `nn.CrossEntropyLoss`\n",
        "5. `nn.MaxPooling2d` (though many implementations without it exist)\n",
        "\n",
        "We encourage you to explore different ways of improving your model to get higher accuracy. Here are some suggestions for things to look into:\n",
        "1. CNN architectures: AlexNet, VGG, ResNets, etc.\n",
        "2. Different optimizers and their parameters (see torch.optim)\n",
        "3. Image preprocessing / data augmentation (see torchvision.transforms)\n",
        "4. Regularization or dropout (see torch.optim and torch.nn respectively)\n",
        "5. Learning rate scheduling: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#how-to-adjust-learning-rate\n",
        "6. Weight initialization: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/nn.init.html\n",
        "\n",
        "Though we encourage you to explore, there are some rules:\n",
        "1. You are not allowed to install or use packages not included by default in the Colab Environment.\n",
        "2. You are not allowed to use any pre-defined architectures or feature extractors in your network.\n",
        "3. You are not allowed to use **any** pretrained weights, ie no transfer learning.\n",
        "4. You cannot train on the test data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Otherwise everything is fair game.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your deliverables are as follows:\n",
        "1. Submit to Kaggle and include your test accuracy in your report.\n",
        "2. Provide at least (1) training curve for your model, depicting loss per epoch or step after training for at least 8 epochs.\n",
        "3. Explain the components of your final model, and how you think your design choices contributed to it's performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "After you write your code, we have included skeleton code that should be used to submit predictions to Kaggle. **You must follow the instructions below under the submission header**. Note that if you apply any processing or transformations to the data, you will need to do the same to the test data otherwise you will likely achieve very low accuracy. \n",
        "\n",
        "It is expected that this task will take a while to train. Our simple solution achieves a training accuracy of 90.2% and a test accuracy of 74.8% after 10 epochs (be careful of overfitting!). This easily beats the best SVM based CIFAR10 model submitted to the HW 1 Kaggle! It is possible to achieve 95% or higher test accuracy on CIFAR 10 with good model design and tuning."
